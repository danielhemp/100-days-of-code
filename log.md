# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 21st 2022


**Today's Progress**: built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game in Javascript

**Thoughts:** This is just a simple game to get restarted with javascript. I felt like it might be a little to simple, but it is a place to start. I'll be adding more to it in the coming days, but I wanted to get it up here first.
